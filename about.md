    <p>I am an Orange County full stack developer.</p>

    <p>I graduated from Michigan State University, determined to learn about the world before making my mark on it. After several years abroad serving in the Peace Corps in Kyrgyzstan and working in Seoul, Korea, I returned home to complete a Master's degree. Eager to apply everything I've learned and tackle new challenges, I am pursuing a lifelong passion for coding that began in middle school when my uncle introduced me to Visual Basic.</p>

    <p>Aside from coding, I love writing and reading, foreign languages, board games, wine, <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128621/viticulture">board games about wine</a>, Central Asia, the ocean, international relations, Michigan State sports, and burritos.</p>
